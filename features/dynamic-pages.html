    <h3>Dynamic Pages</h3>
<p>
  <code>Dynamic Pages</code> operate nearly identically to regular pages,
  however they allow you to create multiple <code>Pages</code> with a single
  entry in your config.yaml. This is excellent for create <code>Pages</code>
  such as blog entries. This features section of the documentation is also
  created using a <code>Dynamic Page</code>. To do this,
  <code>Dynamic Pages</code> require a small amount of extra configuration
  in both your YAML content file and your config.yaml file.
</p>
<p>
  To create a <code>Dynamic Page</code> your YAML content file will be a
  little different. The single YAML file will contain multiple YAML documents
  each of which <em>must</em> specify a <code>slug</code> attribute. A
  shortened version of the YAML file that is used to generate this page looks
  like this:
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/835549.js?file=pages.yaml"></script>
</p>
<p>
  Unlike a regular <code>Page</code>, when creating a
  <code>Dynamic Page</code> it is necessary to specify a <code>url</code>
  attribute in your config.yaml file. That URL must also contain a
  placeholder for which the <code>Dynamic Page</code>'s slug will be
  substituded. A Python <code>datetime</code> object containing the current
  date and time is also made available to your URL. This is handled using
  Python 3's string formatting, so the <code>url</code> for your
  <code>Dynamic Page</code> should look something
  like this:
  <code>url: 'blog/{date.year}/{date.month}/{date.day}/{slug}.html'</code>.
  The config.yaml file that was used to generate this documentation, for
  example, looks like this:
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/835549.js?file=config.yaml"></script>
